# Greatest-Cinema
This is a simple project I had for my university, which involved creating a movie website. The user, before purchasing tickets, would need to register, sign in and later, if they wish, they could log out. However, in the admin section, all the information is stored, including which movie the user will watch, their first and last name, etc.
